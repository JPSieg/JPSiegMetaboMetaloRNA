IMPORTANT NOTE: The backbone-restrained MD simulation of your biomolecule exploded. This usually means
                that your input structure contains some severe atomic clashes, broken bonds, or similar,
                which could not be fixed by the energy minimization. We therefore rerun the simualation
                using frozen coordinates of the biomolecule. Water and counter ions will still be properly simulated,
                so the SWAXS calculations are based on a physically realistic hydration layer. Only the
                flexibility of the solute will not taken into account. For large solutes, neglecting side chain
                fluctutations has probably only a small effect. For small solutes the effect may be signficant
                (for an example, see Chen and Hub, Biophys J, 2014).

If you think your structure should be correct (such as a high-resolution crstal structure), an error in the
MD engine or a PDB file not following PDB conventions may have cause the problem. In that case, please
contact us! Thank you!
