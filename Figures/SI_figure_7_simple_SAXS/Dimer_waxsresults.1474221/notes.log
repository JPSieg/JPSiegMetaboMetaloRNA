Note: removed all ligands (that is, HETATM lines), but kept crystal water
MD simulation:
	Estimate for number of atoms in envelope = 14305 - will generate 126 simulation frames
	Simulation time (ps)    = 66
	Equilibration time (ps) = 3
	Simulation system contained 4290 solute atoms and 20962 water molecules.
	Added 132 Na+ to neutralize the simulation cell.

SAXS/WAXS calculation:
	Maximum q scattering vector [nm-1]:                   10
	Number of solute and pure-sovlent simulation frames:  126
	Simulation time discarded for equilibration (ps):     3
	Correcting solvent density to [e/nm3]:                334
	Number of q-points for spherical average:             Max{500, 0.20*(D*q)^2}  [D = diameter of envelope]
	Distance of envelope from solute [nm]:                0.7
	Volume of envelope [nm3]:                             170.152

	Number of atoms used for rotational fit:              736
	Buffer subtraction scheme:                            Total buffer intensity subtracted

Fitting the experimental data to the calculated data on a linear scale was successful.
	Carried out a weighted fit, because 3 columns were found in experimental intensity file.
	Fitting results f/c for I(fitted) = f*I(given) + c
	Overall scale: f   = 1.08159e+08
	Offset added:  c   = -1.80941e+06
	Fit quality:   chi = 0.750852 +- 0.00209357

Fitting the experimental data to the calculated data on a non-weighted logarithmic scale was successful.
	Fitting results f/c for I(fitted) = f*I(given) + c
	Overall scale: f   = 1.23441e+08
	Offset added:  c   = 3.58793
	Fit quality:   chi = 1e+10 +- 0 (log scale)

Guinier fit:
	Rg [A] = 31.9188
	For comparison: Rg(solute) [A] = 31.8839
