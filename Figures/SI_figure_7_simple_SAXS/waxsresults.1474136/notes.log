Note: removed all ligands (that is, HETATM lines), but kept crystal water
MD simulation:
	Estimate for number of atoms in envelope = 7322 - will generate 211 simulation frames
	Simulation time (ps)    = 110.5
	Equilibration time (ps) = 5
	Simulation system contained 2145 solute atoms and 7838 water molecules.
	Added 66 Na+ to neutralize the simulation cell.

SAXS/WAXS calculation:
	Maximum q scattering vector [nm-1]:                   10
	Number of solute and pure-sovlent simulation frames:  211
	Simulation time discarded for equilibration (ps):     5
	Correcting solvent density to [e/nm3]:                334
	Number of q-points for spherical average:             Max{500, 0.20*(D*q)^2}  [D = diameter of envelope]
	Distance of envelope from solute [nm]:                0.7
	Volume of envelope [nm3]:                             82.7538

	Buffer subtraction scheme:                            Total buffer intensity subtracted

Fitting the experimental data to the calculated data on a linear scale was successful.
	Carried out a weighted fit, because 3 columns were found in experimental intensity file.
	Fitting results f/c for I(fitted) = f*I(given) + c
	Overall scale: f   = 5.40319e+07
	Offset added:  c   = -869788
	Fit quality:   chi = 1.40499 +- 0.00286865

Fitting the experimental data to the calculated data on a non-weighted logarithmic scale was successful.
	Fitting results f/c for I(fitted) = f*I(given) + c
	Overall scale: f   = 8.66221e+08
	Offset added:  c   = 3.58793
	Fit quality:   chi = 1e+10 +- 0 (log scale)

Guinier fit:
	Rg [A] = 19.6933
	For comparison: Rg(solute) [A] = 19.07
